# WINDSHIELD

A Node.js Rendering Platform

<br>

## Pre-Install

Update your `nginx.conf` (see `nginx.conf` in project root) and start nginx.

Also, you'll need a few global npm packages:

    npm install -g nodemon jasmine

<br>

## Install

```
git clone http://your-username-here@git.cars.com/scm/mp/windshield.git
cd windshield
npm install
```

<br>

## Run

```
npm start
```

<br>

## TODO

  - Support for query assets
  - Support for siteplan (to support navigation)
  - Request and render embedded assets
  - Publish modules currently in `lib` to private npm and pull in via package.
